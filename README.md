# ODU_code_sample_todo_app

I have implemented a sample Todo App using a fake JsonPlaceholder API
Functionalities:
1. User will be able to search todo's and select the one to add to the list
    (In my previous project we are having the feature, where user can search for the bonds/Securities buy typing the title/name of the bond. Onclick on the one of the bond in the dropdown, it will be added to the list)
2. The API provides a property called "completed", I utilized it to style the completed todo using css
    (In our project there are some matured bonds, which cannot be traded, so we disable and gray-out that row)
3. The Todo app has a delete feature which is similar to delete bond from the list.

Please let me know, if you have any questions about the implementation, I would be more than happy to walk through.

Thank you Kevin.
